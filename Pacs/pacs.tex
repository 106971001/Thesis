\begin{abstract}
	The impact of Automated Trading Systems (ATS) on financial markets is growing every year and the trades generated by an algorithm now account for the majority of orders that arrive at stock exchanges. In this paper we explore a trading strategy based on reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning that allows to find an optimal strategy for a sequential decision problem by directly interacting with the environment. We show that the the long-short strategy learned for a synthetic asset, whose price follows a stochastic process with some exploitable patterns, consistently outperforms the market. This demonstrates the applicability of reinforcement learning to many financial problems, which can be often formulated as sequential decision problems.
